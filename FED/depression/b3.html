            David took a break from studies for a while to focus on what he is feeling.
            <br>
            <br>
            “You know you have tried your best. Cool, let’s think of alternatives to study better.”
            <br>
            <br>
            He knows that he is overwhelmed and severely affected by his academics.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, he should calm down and take a step back before seeking help from his parents, teachers and peers
            to do better. “They have always been supportive and I know I can do better as long as I continue to try.”
